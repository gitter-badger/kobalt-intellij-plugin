//FIXME this is a workaround for problem with missing Closable.kt inside kotlin-runtime.jar. Intellij IDEA still have the outdated version of Kotlin (1.0.5) and have the old kotlin-runtime.jar inside INSTALL_DIR/lib folder.
//TODO this should be removed after IDEA updates it's kotlin runtime to the new version
